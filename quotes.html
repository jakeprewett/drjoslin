     <h3><p>
     <p></h3><ol>
     <p>"The diabetic who knows the most, lives the longest."
     <p>"It is better to discuss how far you have walked, then how little you have eaten."
     <p>"A well trained nurse is of more value than the patient’s doctors."
     <p>"We can only scratch one back at a time, but we can teach many patients together and each is likely to teach another."
     <p>"The man who gives up an active outdoor life and is promoted to an office chair by this change becomes a promising candidate for diabetes."
     <p>"The person with diabetes needs character building just as much as body building… personal responsibility for his own and family welfare should always be cultivated in the foreground."
     <p>"Learn as if you have to learn forever, live as if you die tomorrow."
     </ol>
